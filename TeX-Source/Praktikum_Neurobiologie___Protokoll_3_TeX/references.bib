abstract="The paper is dealing in its first part with a system-theoretical approach for the decomposition of multi-input systems into the sum of simpler systems. By this approach the algorithm for the computations underlying the extraction of motion information from the optical environment by biological movement detectors is analysed. In the second part it concentrates on a specific model for motion computation known to be realized by the visual system of insects and of man. These motion detectors provide the visual system with information on both, velocity and structural properties of a moving pattern. The last part of the paper deals with the functional properties of two-dimensional arrays of movement detectors. They are analyzed and their relations to meaningful physiological responses are discussed.",
